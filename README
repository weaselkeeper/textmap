Old code that takes an 8bit ascii file, and presents a graphical
visualization of symbol frequency in the supplied text.

Output is via postscript, either redirected to a file, or piped to a postscript
viewer such as ghostview.


e.g.
./textmap.py <input file> > output.ps

It's pretty crude, but kindof fun to see how patterns emerge from text, either
raw, or encrypted.
